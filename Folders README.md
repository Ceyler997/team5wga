# Team5wga Folders
When creating scene, please, add new scene to 'Scenes' folder and add a folder with scene name in the 'Assets' folder<br/>
Trying to keep all files for your scene in this folder<br/>
<br/>
Special folders:<br/>
* BattleScene - folder for main game scene resources
* General Managers - for managers scripts, that can be used in many scenes
* LauncherScene - folder for launcher resources
* Materials - for all materials in the game
* Mesh - for all meshes in the game
* MiniMap - folder for mini-map resources
* Photon Unity Networking - for PUN files
* PlanarMeshGenerator - for NavMesh generation
* Plugins - for PUN too (change this, if you add something to folder)
* Resources - for prefabs, that will be used for synchronizable objects (for more information look at Synchronization README.md)
* StreamingAssets - for files, that will be moved to device without changing (for localization at the moment)
* TestScenes - folder for temporary scenes for functionality testing
* TO CHECK - unchecked files, probably, should be deleted

Example a name of folders inside your folder 'Scene':
* Mesh - for meshes
* Materials - for materials
* Script - for scripts on the C#
* Prefab - for prefabs
